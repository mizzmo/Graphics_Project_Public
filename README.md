<h3 id='desc'>Description</h3>
I implemented this scene to act as a unique way to demonstrate several, simple to advanced, computer graphics techniques using different types of objects. This scene utilities a dimly lit setting to better demonstrate shiny surfaces in simulated moon light, while encompassing different glowing objects to showcase interactions between light sources and effect on transparency, which interactive elements to remove said light sources for a different effect.

This scene shows procedurally generated desert dunes in a starry night sky. On the dunes there is a 3D pyramid surrounded by a transparent cone of light leading up to a large, spinning UFO. The UFO is producing a glowing green colour, while projecting 4 red spinning spotlights on the ground around the pyramid. Circling the UFO is a jet plane. In the background there are some Egyptian ruins showcasing different transparent layers, aimed to represent stained glass, and sitting on those ruins is a large ancient vase. Looking up at the sky we see procedurally generated, animated shooting stars.

<i>The inspiration for this scene comes mainly from Egypt and the pyramids, as well as folklore regarding how the pyramids were created, specifically the theory that they were built by aliens, to put a more interesting spin on a typical desert scene. This also helped to showcase more lighting elements with an interactive UFO.</i>
